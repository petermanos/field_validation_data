## Field Validation Data
This geopackage contains information on field stations in the Northeastern US. Location data of each field station is stored with data availability, 
and a list of the variables collected at the site. The metadata file describes the columns in each table, the tutorial gives an overview of accessing the data in QGIS, and
the .gpkg is the database to be downloaded.
